# Instructions for Running Python Files with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn

This README provides instructions for setting up and running Python files containing code for this project that utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and Scikit-Learn for machine learning tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Python files, ensure that you have the following installed:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

   - **Windows**: Download the Python installer from the website and run it. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
   
   - **macOS**: You can install Python using Homebrew by running `brew install python3` in your terminal.
   
   - **Linux**: Python usually comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. If not, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install python3`.

2. **Pandas**: Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. You can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install pandas
    ```

3. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. You can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install matplotlib
    ```

4. **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. You can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install numpy
    ```

5. **Scikit-Learn**: Scikit-Learn is a machine learning library for Python. You can install it via pip:
    ```
    pip install scikit-learn
    ```

## Running Python Files

To run a Python file containing the provided code:

1. **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the directory containing the Python file you want to run.

2. **Execute the Python File**: Run the Python file using the Python interpreter. For example:
    ```
    python filename.py
    ```
    Or
    ```
    python3 filename.py
    ```
    Replace `filename.py` with the name of your Python file.

    The filenames: 

    `SDI_Prediction_2019.py`

    `SDI_Prediction_2020.py`

    `Pearson_Corelation_Shorter.py`

    `Pearson_Correlation_Coefficient_Manual.py`

    `Calculate_Mean_R-SQ_Absolute_Error.py`

    'k_means_clusterofcountries.py'


4. **View Output**: Depending on the code in the Python file, it may generate output such as plots or printed results. Check the output as specified in the file.

## Additional Notes

- **Permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the files and directories where you want to run the Python files. If you encounter permission errors, try running the terminal or command prompt as an administrator or using the appropriate permissions.

- **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that your Python environment is properly configured, and there are no conflicts with dependencies. You can use virtual environments to manage dependencies for different projects and avoid conflicts.

- **Python Environment Management**: Consider using tools like `virtualenv` or `conda` to manage Python environments. These tools allow you to create isolated environments for your projects, which can help in avoiding conflicts between dependencies.
